  A_day_in_the_life:
    As an FEE 2 at Amazon, your day is filled with diverse and engaging activities. You typically start by diving into coding, implementing new features or improving existing ones with high-quality, efficient front-end code. Throughout the day, you participate in code reviews, offering constructive feedback to your teammates and ensuring you all maintain high standards. Collaboration is a big part of your role - you work closely with UX designers, product managers, and backend engineers to understand requirements and integrate the front-end with APIs. You contribute to software design discussions, create technical designs for your assigned tasks, and write unit tests to ensure code reliability.
    You're also involved in operational support, keeping an eye on system health and jumping in to resolve any production issues that arise. You make sure to update documentation as you implement changes and often find yourself mentoring junior engineers or interns. Project management is part of your responsibilities too - you update task statuses, estimate efforts for upcoming work, and participate in sprint planning and retrospectives.
    You're always learning, staying updated on the latest front-end technologies and sharing knowledge with your team. You focus on performance optimization, ensuring the front-end is as fast and efficient as possible. Accessibility and internationalization are also key considerations in your work, as you strive to create the best possible user experience for all customers. While your specific tasks might vary depending on current projects and priorities, you work independently on most tasks, seeking guidance when you encounter particularly complex challenges or architectural decisions. It's a dynamic role that keeps you engaged and growing every day.
